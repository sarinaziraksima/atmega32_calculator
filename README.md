# ATmega32_calculator
In this project, a calculator is coded in Atmel Studio to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, cosine, and sine. The design has been practically implemented on an ATmega32, which is connected to a keypad and an LCD. A special feature is that the equivalent value of the calculator is saved and can be accessed using a button. Itâ€™s worth mentioning that in practical applications, a pull-down resistor is needed, as the internal pull-down resistors of the ATmega32 are not used.

This project allowed me to invest a few weeks of my time to fully understand the code and the difficulties of practical applications.
